This is NOT an addon. Extract to the garrysmod folder with the rest of the stuff there.

This is also NOT a gamemode designed for singleplayer / against NPC zombies. This is designed for games of at least 4 human players, although the zs_options file can be edited to allow lower amounts.


Way too numerous features have been added since the last release (1.11) to be listed.
It's best you just find out yourself.
You can also view the updates and publishes forum on http://noxiousnet.com which contains the update logs to ZS (as well as other gamemodes there).


Three maps have been included although there are hundreds on the Internet (most of which are of very poor quality).
This gamemode also works perfectly with any map you feed it. It will work with anything from de_dust to Counter-Strike zm_ maps and pretty much anything based on the Source engine.
